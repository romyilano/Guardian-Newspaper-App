# GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER NETWORKING SAMPLE

## About
This is a quick and dirty iPhone networking app using Mashery's Guardian Newspaper  API

Note: the API key is gitignored, so you have to go get your own
if you want to run this on your phone or the simulator

# To-Do

* Search with ability to set parameters
* add test-driven development - there are still no provisions for nil
